\chapter{Challenges In Relative Pose Estimation}

This chapter will examine the preconditions and the feasability of pose recovery
in realistic conditions. Several problematic cases will be identified and
described. Furthermore, an assessment of different feature detection algorithms
for the purpose of this work will be given.
