\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I wish to acknowledge the contributions of many people who---directly or
indirectly---supported this work. 

I thank Professor Oliver Vornberger, whose proposal of this topic came just at
the right time and who granted me the freedom to shape it on my own terms, and
Ann-Katrin Becker who drafted the initial plan for the application and
proved to be a constant source of useful advice.

Furthermore, I am grateful to Dr. Thomas Wiemann for his tech support
whenever CMake refused to bend to my will, and his readiness to act as
co-examiner.

None of the work would have been possible without the countless indviduals who
developed the long list of open source tools which I use on a daily basis.
Notably the entire \LaTeX\ community---developers and helpful users alike, the
developers of the OpenCV library, Vim, git and all UNIX tools and the
StackOverflow community where few questions go unanswered.

Writing a thesis is dull, especially alone and thus I was happy to suffer and
occasionally laugh alongside Inga, Lara and Lisa, who---perhaps unbeknownst to
them---kept my motivation on an at least partially productive level and Simon
and Julius for providing shelter and squirrels in times of need.

Particular thanks are owed to Lisa and Lea for proofreading this work.

% Lastly, I owe a great debt to my family whose support knows no bounds. For this,
% there are no words, so I shall give none.
